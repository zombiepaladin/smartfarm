		The Smartfarm software allows students to simulate a farm,
		planning their own agricultural practices, planting crops,
		applying chemicals, irrigating, rotating, tilling, harvesting, etc. 
		But thatâ€™s just the surface level, as students can (and are encouraged to)
		investigate and reprogram the models driving the simulation using a
		Scratch-like programming interface.  By modifying the models underlying
		the simulation, students can use inquiry to explore how nutrients and
		pollutants move through an ecosystem, experiment with altering crop
		characteristics, and develop scientific and statistical modeling skills.
